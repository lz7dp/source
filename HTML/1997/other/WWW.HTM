      <h2>How to use this server</h2>
      <p>This is an email-based server. It allows the retrieval by
      electronic mail of text files from the World-Wide Web. It does not
      offer any other facilities, and in particular it is <em>not</em>
      a gateway to Usenet News, and cannot be used to retrieve
      graphics or other binary files (with some exceptions: see below).</p>
      <h3>To request a document</h3>
      <p>Send a one-line email message to this address:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <bodytext>
          <pre>webmail@www.ucc.ie</pre>
        </bodytext>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Put the command in the text body (nowhere else):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <bodytext>
          <pre>SEND <i>url</i></pre>
        </bodytext>
      </blockquote>
      <p>where <i>url</i> is the Uniform Resource Locator of the
      document you wish to retrieve (see below for details of
      URLs). For example, to retrieve this document, send the line</p>
      <blockquote>
        <bodytext>
          <pre>SEND http://www.ucc.ie/webmail/webmail.html</pre>
        </bodytext>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Do <em>NOT</em> put the command in the Subject
      line.<br>Do <em>NOT</em> use MIME, HTML, Word, or other
      formatting.</strong></p>
      <h3>Other commands</h3>
      <p>The <tt>SEND</tt> command retrieves a formatted version of
      the file. To retrieve the HTML source text from which is was
      generated, use the <samp>GET</samp> or <samp>GO</samp> commands
      in the same way. See below for details of the differences.</p>
      <h3>URLs</h3>
      <p>A Uniform Resource Locator is the <q>address</q> of a file in
      the Web. The structure of a URL is:</p>
      <table frame="border" border>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><p><tt><b>http:</b></tt></td>

            <td><p><tt><b>catalog/</b></tt></td>
            <td><p><tt><b>order.html</b></tt></td>
            <td><p>optionally followed by one

          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td valign="top"><p>Options may follow:<br><tt>?</tt>

                after the file(script)name, but instead of a single
                searchword, fields are separated by
                <code>&amp;</code>s, and are composed of the
                fieldname, an <code>=</code> sign and the field value
                according to MIME type <var>x-www-urlencoded</var>
                (spaces replaced by plus signs, all non-alphanumerics
                replaced by <code>%</code>-escaped two-byte
                hexadecimal), <i>eg</i></p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><strong>Please note that WebMail does not handle NEWS or FTP
       access: the processing capacity and network bandwidth available
       make it impossible to support these protocols. For
       reasons which should be obvious, TELNET and MAILTO are also not
       possible.</strong></p>
      <h2><a name="cmds" id="cmds">Return format</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The <samp>SEND</samp> command sends back a copy of the
        file in a formatted version so that you can use it in an
        editor or wordprocessor.</li>
        <li><p>The <samp>GET</samp> command sends back a copy of the
        file in its raw (HTML-encoded) state so that you can use it in
        a local browser.</li>
        <li><p>The old <samp>GO</samp> command does both: it send the
        HTML file and a copy of the formatted version.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In all cases, the output will be UUencoded if it contains
       non-printing (non-ASCII) characters. These are forbidden in
       many email systems as they stand, so they are UUencoded to
       prevent the file being garbled unintentionally. To decode the
       file, you need a copy of the UUDECODE program, which is in the
       public domain and should be available from your network
       provider or computer centre. Output containing characters which
       are illegal in ISO 8859-1 will also be UUencoded and a warning
       appended that these characters are not valid in HTML files.</p>
      <h3>Viewing the results</h3>
      <p>To view the HTML file, you need a browser program or an
       editor, preferably an <a
       href="http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html">SGML</a>-conformant
       editor. There are details of these at <tt><a
       href="http://www.ucc.ie/webstart.html">
       http://www.ucc.ie/webstart.html</a></tt></p>
      <h2>Service level</h2>
      <p>It has been necessary to impose some restrictions on the
       server, as it was being abused by a few thoughtless individuals.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>To avoid users clogging the queue, the server only
               handles one request per message, but an additional HELP
               or DOC command will be honoured.</p></li>
        <li><p><cite>WebMail</cite> will not send binary files,
               executable programs, images like GIFs or JPEGs,
               PostScript print files, audio files, movies and
               compressed binary or archive files (zip, tar, gz, sea,
               hqx, zoo <i>etc</i>).</p><p><strong>This restriction is
               currently lifted on an experimental basis for
               PostScript and Acrobat files, executable binaries
               including overlays, and most compressed archive or
               self-extractor files.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p>WebMail cannot be used to access FTP archives. For
               ftp-by-mail, use the server at
               <tt>ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com</tt>.</p></li>
        <li><p>There is a size limit of 1.44Mb (one high-density
               floppy disk size) on all files retrieved: files larger
               than this cannot be returned.</p><p><strong>This restriction
               is being lifted for a few specific sites on an
               experimental basis: all files from
               <tt>www.sil.org</tt>, <tt>www.tug.org</tt>, and
               <tt>www.jclark.com</tt>
               can now be retrieved regardless of size. Other sites
               may be added in the future.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><a id="cmds" name="cmds">Commands no longer have to
               start in the first character position on the line</a>,
               although this is recommended as good practice: extra
               spacing is unnecessary but will not cause an
               error.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>A request must be a single line: the command must be on
          the same line as the URL. If your mail editor reformats your
          outgoing text and inserts linebreaks when the URL is very
          long, either disable the reformatting or use another mailer.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Do not include a signature (<samp>.sig</samp> file) in
        your message.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do not use your mail program's <code>REPLY</code>
        function (button or command) to send another command to
        <cite>WebMail</cite>. In order to prevent mail bouncing from
        bad addresses, the <code>Reply-To</code> address does not
        point back at the server.</p></li>
        <li><p><cite>WebMail</cite> does not (cannot and will not)
        return linked files (the DEEP command of other web-by-mail
        systems). To do so would be extremely dangerous, as
        some files contain 100 or more links, and the accumulated
        volume would be too much to handle. You must request each link
        you want separately.</p></li>
        <li><p>Most requests are processed within 20 minutes of
        receipt. When the queue gets longer than 500 messages, the
        response time may exceed 1 day. Please be patient, especially
        when the service has just been publicised in a magazine
        article: you were not the only person to read it!</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Other commands</h2>
      <p>Apart from <samp>SEND</samp>, <samp>GO</samp> and
      <samp>GET</samp>, the command</p>
      <pre>     HELP</pre>
      <p>on its own will send back this file in both HTML and plain
      text formats.</p>
      <pre>     DOC</pre>
      <p>on its own will send back this file in PostScript.</p>
